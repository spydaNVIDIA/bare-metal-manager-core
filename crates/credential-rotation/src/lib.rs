//! Shared per-device credential rotation engine.
//!
//! `RotateCredential` only *stages* a site-wide rotation: it writes the
//! rotate-TO secret at the next version and bumps
//! `sitewide_credential_rotation.target_version`. This crate houses the engine
//! that *converges* an individual device to that staged target, so the
//! machine-, switch-, and power-shelf-controllers share one implementation
//! instead of each re-deriving the BMC password dance.
//!
//! Today it implements BMC rotation ([`rotate_bmc`]); Host/DPU UEFI rotation
//! reuses the controllers' existing job-polling UEFI-setup state machines and
//! lives there.
//!
//! # BMC flow (single synchronous step + crash marker)
//!
//! The BMC password primitive
//! ([`carbide_redfish::libredfish::RedfishClientPool::set_bmc_root_password`])
//! is synchronous (no BIOS job to poll), so BMC rotation is one step guarded by
//! the `rotating_to_version` crash marker:
//!
//! 1. Read [`device_rotation_status`]; skip converged / quarantined / orphaned
//!    rows.
//! 2. [`mark_device_rotating_to_version`] to the live target (crash marker).
//! 3. Change the password with **change-then-verify recovery**: authenticate
//!    with the current per-device secret and change to the rotate-TO value. On
//!    failure, ask the BMC whether the rotate-TO value *already* authenticates
//!    ([`RedfishClientPool::bmc_credentials_valid`]) -- if so, a prior attempt
//!    changed the hardware before crashing and the device is already at target.
//!    This never re-issues a same-value (`new -> new`) change, which some BMCs
//!    reject under a password-reuse policy, and costs at most one extra failed
//!    login so it stays clear of BMC lockout.
//! 4. On success (or an already-at-target verify): persist the per-device secret
//!    at the new password, flush cached BMC Redfish sessions, and
//!    [`promote_rotating_to_current`].
//! 5. On failure: [`increment_rotate_attempt`] with a redacted error and an
//!    exponential [`backoff_until`] window, and report
//!    [`RotateOutcome::Quarantined`].
//!
//! Crash safety: a crash between step 2 and step 4 leaves `rotating_to_version`
//! set and `current_version` behind the target, so the next tick re-enters and
//! the change-then-verify recovery reconciles the hardware regardless of which
//! side of the change the crash landed on. A target that advanced in the
//! meantime is superseded automatically: step 2 re-marks to the *live* target
//! every tick.
//!
//! The recovery path intentionally does not re-apply the vendor password policy
//! ([`carbide_redfish::libredfish::RedfishClientPool::set_bmc_root_password`]
//! applies it on every change). That policy is a *static* per-vendor setting,
//! and every password the device has ever carried -- including its initial
//! provisioning value -- was set through `set_bmc_root_password`, so a device
//! already at the rotate-TO value already has the policy in effect; recovery has
//! nothing to restore.
//!
//! # Entry gate ([`BmcRotationGate`])
//!
//! Controllers must not pay a per-device `device_rotation_status` query on every
//! 30-second sweep. [`BmcRotationGate`] caches the cheap per-type aggregate
//! ([`rotation_status`]) with a short TTL, so a controller's per-object entry
//! guard ([`BmcRotationGate::bmc_rotation_needed`]) hits the database per-device
//! only when the site-wide aggregate says some device actually lags. In steady
//! state (nothing staged, or fully converged) the gate is one cached aggregate
//! query per TTL window, not O(devices).
