# Hardware Prerequisites

This page covers the hardware requirements for both the NICo site controller and the compute systems it manages.

## Site Controller

The site controller runs the NICo control plane on a Kubernetes cluster. A minimum of 3 nodes is required for high availability; 5 nodes are recommended for large GB200-class sites.

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Server class | Any major OEM Gen5 server (e.g. Dell R760-class) |
| CPU | 2x modern x86_64 sockets (Intel Xeon / AMD EPYC), 24+ cores per socket |
| Memory | 256 GiB minimum, 512 GiB recommended |
| OS storage | 200-500 GiB NVMe SSD space (UEFI + Secure Boot) |
| K8s data storage | 1+ TiB NVMe SSD space dedicated to containerd, Kubelet, and logs |
| Networking | 1-2x 25/100 GbE ports (single-homed or dual-homed) |
| Out-of-band | BMC/iDRAC/iLO/XClarity (DHCP or statically addressed) |
| TPM | TPM 2.0 module present and enabled in BIOS/UEFI |
| Secure Erase | All local storage drives must support Secure Erase |

**Operating system**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, kernel 6.8+. Swap disabled (or minimal), NUMA enabled, virtualization/IOMMU enabled. Time sync: chrony or equivalent, synced to enterprise NTP.

**Storage layout**: Total local NVMe capacity should be 4 TiB or greater. Mount 1.7 TiB on `/` (root) on the NVMe OS disk (ext4 or xfs) — typical usage is 200–500 GiB. Mount `/var/lib/containerd` and `/var/lib/kubelet` on a separate NVMe data disk (1+ TiB, ext4/xfs, `noatime`). Consider a dedicated `/var/log` if there is heavy logging. Persistent app storage (SAN/NAS, Rook-Ceph) is not required for NICo itself.

### DPUs on Site Controller (Required)

Today, site-controller nodes must have Bluefield-3 DPUs. Ensure the following requirements are met:
- Verify the correct DPU power cable has been ordered from the server vendor.
- The Bluefield-3's operating mode is DPU mode (not NIC mode). Today, NIC mode is not supported.
- For BF3 DPUs, verify link speed and optics: BF3 runs at 200 Gb, so match ports to 200 Gb-capable optics, fiber, or DACs.
- Verify that the DPU can connect to the outside world (curl -k https://www.google.com)
- The DPUs are at the latest supported firmware version: DOCA 2.9.3 and HBN 2.4.3

## Compute Systems (Managed Hosts)

Each managed host is a server paired with one or more NVIDIA BlueField DPUs. The DPU provides the primary data-plane connectivity and acts as the enforcement boundary for NICo.

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Server class | An [NVIDIA-certified system](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-deploy-on-premises/nvidia-certified-systems/index.html) with a data center classification |
| GPU | Refer to the [Hardware Compatibility List](../../hcl.md) for supported GPUs and systems. |
| DPU | One or more BlueField DPUs with 2x 200 Gb network interfaces and a 1 Gb BMC interface|
| Local storage | NVMe drives must support Secure Erase; firmware must be updated only via signed images; rollback must not be possible. |
| TPM | TPM 2.0 with Secure Boot support |
| UEFI | Must support preventing in-band host control. |
| Chassis BMC | Must support the following Redfish operations: power control, boot order, UEFI secure boot toggle, IPv6, firmware update, Serial-over-LAN |

The BlueField-3 B3220 P-Series DPU is suitable: 200GbE/NDR200 dual-port QSFP112 Network Adaptor (900-9D3B6-00CV-AA0). Other NICs on the host are automatically disabled during NICo installation.

NICo does not require any cabling or communication between the DPU and the host.

## Supported Hardware

For a list of tested host machines, DPUs, and validated firmware versions, refer to the [Hardware Compatibility List](../../hcl.md) page.

## BIOS/UEFI Settings

The following settings should be enabled on site controller and compute system BIOS/UEFI:

- **UEFI + Secure Boot** (with signed kernel/modules)
- **VT-x / AMD-V + IOMMU**
- **SR-IOV** (if using NIC VFs; otherwise leave off)
- **NTP** (locked to enterprise sources; clock drift alarms enabled)
